Highlander:

A web-app for softball and baseball coaches that will track team athletic engagement on the field via hits, at-bats, RBI's, strikeouts etc. Highlander will accumulate the team stats and provide player averages for a particular category in a leaderboard.

The ultimate place for players to talk trash.
